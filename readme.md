jQuery inlineComplete Plugin
=========

This was forked from https://github.com/patrickburke/ 's original version.
- Removed a lot of the unused code and the unimplemented options.
- Added Tab completion.
- Would consider it in a usable state but by no means good.


Working on
- Handling Esc and arrow keys
- Case sensitive matching
- More ways to load lists.

Look at index.html/js for a demo its pretty straightforward.
